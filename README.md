# Math Trainer

Math Trainer is a simple android application developed on Android Studio with Java. It is one of my initial projects in the journey of learning android development. This application allows you to brush up your math basic calculations like Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. Its an easy to play android game with a timer to make you think and solve the basic equations faster.
